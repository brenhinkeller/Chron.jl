    ```Julia
    bilinear_exponential(x::Number, p::AbstractVector)
    ```
    Evaluate the value of a "bilinear exponential" function defined by the parameters
    `p` at point `x`. This function, which can be used to approximate various asymmetric
    probability distributions found in geochronology, is defined by an exponential
    function with two log-linear segments joined by an `atan` sigmoid:
    ```math
    ℯ^{p_1 + v x_s p_4^2 p_5^2 - (1-v) x_s p_4^2/p_5^2}
    ```
    where
    ```math
    v = 1/2 - atan(x_s)/π
    ```
    is a sigmoid, positive on the left-hand side, and
    ```math
    x_s = (x - p_2)/p_3^2
    ```
    is `x` scaled by mean and variance.

    The elements of the parameter array `p` may be considered to approximately represent\n
        p[1] # pre-exponential (log normaliation constant)
        p[2] # mean (central moment)
        p[3] # standard deviation

    ```Julia
    bilinear_exponential_ll(x, p)
    ```
    Return the log likelihood corresponding to a `bilinear_exponential` distribution defined
    by the parameters `p` evaluate at point `x`.

    If `x` is provided as a number and `p` as a vector, a single evaluation will
    be returned; if `x` is provided as a vector and `p` as a matrix, the sum
    over all i for each distribution `p[:,i]` evaluated at `x[i]` will be returned
    instead.
